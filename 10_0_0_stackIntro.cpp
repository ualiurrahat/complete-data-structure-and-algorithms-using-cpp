// Stack is a linear data structure which is an abstract data type(ADT)
// ADT means random access of elements are not allowed
// we will have to perform insertion deletion in a very specified order

// stack property:
// 1. entry and exit point is same
// 2 insertion is called : push(x)
// 3 deletion is called  : pop() ....deletes the top element
// 4 top elment          : top() ... last inserted element
// 5. Stack follow LIFO method
// LIFO: last in first out

// use of stack:
// 1. recursion also uses stack: recursive stack
