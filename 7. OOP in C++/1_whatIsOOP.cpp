/*
OOP: Object Oriented Programming
- a programming style that we used to follow in modern programming

Object: basic simple entities that posses some properties & funcitons
- ex: everything around us is object. laptop,camera,keyboard, human, all things

why we are using object in programming?
- we want our code to look like real worlds. just like real worlds are full with objects
and they interact with each other, we also want to do the same in coding.
that makes our job easy.

Class: a blueprint that defines the properties and funcitons of an object.
