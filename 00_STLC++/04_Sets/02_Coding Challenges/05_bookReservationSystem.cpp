// Question: Reserve Books
// You are developing a reservation system for a library that allows students to reserve books.
// Each student can reserve multiple copies of the same book. Your task is to implement the reservation system
// which returns all the required books in ascending order of their title.
//
// Input Format:
// The first line of input contains an integer N â€” the size of both the vectors.
// The second line contains N space-separated strings - the title of books.
// The third line contains N space-separated positive integers - the reservations against each book.
//
// Output Format:
// Output on a single line K space-separated titles of the books in sorted alphabetical order - where K is the total reserved books.
