/*
Question:
You are given a string of size N. Count the number of distinct characters in it and also the frequency of each character.

Input Format:
- First line of the input contains a positive integer T - the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N â€” the size of the string.
- The second line of each test case contains a string of size N.

Output Format:
For each test case:
- Output on a new line an integer K - the number of distinct characters in the string.
- On K next lines print two space-separated values - the character and its frequency.
  Characters should be printed in sorted order (i.e., from 'a' to 'z').
