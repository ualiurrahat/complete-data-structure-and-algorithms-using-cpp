/*
the problem with array: once it is declared, we can not add more elements.
as array is a contiguous part of the memeory.Even deletion is also tiresome.
So we needed a data structure where we can add data as per our wish.
That's where Linked List comes in.
Linked List: a data structure that is consist of nodes, where each node
has two property: 1) data, 2) address of the next node

the first node of LL is called Head
the last one is called Tail
